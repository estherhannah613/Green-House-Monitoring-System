# AUTONOMOUS GREENHOUSE CONTROL SYSTEM

## Overview

This project implements an **Autonomous Greenhouse Control System** using an STM32F405 microcontroller.  
It continuously monitors **temperature**, **humidity**, and **ambient light levels**, then controls a fan, bulbs, and an LED bar graph to maintain optimal conditions inside the greenhouse.  
Access is secured using a 4-digit passkey system with a random code displayed on a 7-segment display and verified via a 4x4 keypad.
